🚲📊 Excel Dashboard Project: Bike Sales Analysis 🧠 Tool Used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)  I recently worked on a Bike Sales Dashboard project using Excel to analyze customer purchase behavior. dataset included demographic and lifestyle information of customers such as:

🔍 Columns Analyzed:

Gender, Age, Marital Status, Income, Children

Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance

Region, and whether they Purchased a Bike

📌 Key insights extracted through my dashboard:
✅ Higher bike purchase rates among individuals aged 30–45
✅ Homeowners and individuals with higher education levels were more likely to purchase
✅ Commute distance influenced the decision to buy a bike
✅ Regional variations showed differing buyer patterns

📊 The dashboard includes:

Interactive filters (e.g., Region, Gender, Age Group)

KPI cards for total sales, buyer percentage, and income insights

Dynamic charts for better visualization and decision-making

📚 This project helped sharpen my skills in:

Data cleaning & formatting

Pivot tables & dashboards

Interpreting customer behavior through visual storytelling
